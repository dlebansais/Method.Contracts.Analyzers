# MCA2004: InitializeWith attribute not allowed in public class

If a class is `public` any other assembly can access it and create a new instance of the class without calling the initialization method. Make the class `internal`, and if another assembly needs to access it:

+ Add the other assembly name to a `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute in the assembly containing the class.
+ Add the `Method.Contract.Analyzers` NuGet package to the other assembly, so that it can detect the missing call.

You can't force other assemblies to add the analyzer, but you can do that in assemblies that you explicitly list as friends with `InternalsVisibleTo`, typically for a test project.

## Sample code

````csharp
using Contracts;

[InitializeWith(nameof(Initialize))]
public class Foo // Non compliant
{
    public void Initialize()
    {
    }
}
````

````csharp
using Contracts;

[InitializeWith(nameof(Initialize))]
internal class Foo // Compliant
{
    public void Initialize()
    {
    }
}
````
