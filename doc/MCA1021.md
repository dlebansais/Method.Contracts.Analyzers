# MCA1021: Only use Contract.Map with in-site dictionary.

This rule check whether the second argument in call to `Contract.Map()` is a dictionary created in-site, as opposed to created elsewhere and used in the call. The reason for this rule is warn about unintended use of `Contract.Map()` as explained below.

When using a `switch` statement or expression to handle enum values, one wants to add the `default` case in case the enum is extended later. For example:

```cs
enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

private static void Foo(Color c)
{
    switch (c)
    {
        case Color.Red:
            return 0xFF0000;
        case Color.Green:
            return 0x00FF00;
        case Color.Blue:
            return 0x0000FF;
        deafult:
            throw new InvalidArgumentException(nameof(c));
    }
}
```

When doing this, the `default` case is probably untestable, and will look bad on code coverage reports. One solution is to turn the `switch` statement into a dictionary lookup, as follow:

```cs
private static void Foo(Color c)
{
    System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int> Table = new()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
    };

    return Table[c];
}
```

The code coverage is now better, but this solution has two drawbacks.

+ The exception thrown is 'invalid key', it doesn't really tell you it's because a new value was added to `Color`.
+ The problem still only shows at run time.

To fix that, one can use the `Contract.Map` method instead:


```cs
private static void Foo(Color c)
{
    return Contract.Map(c, new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int>()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
    });
}
```

The MCA1021 rule warns you that you should use `new Dictionary<...>()` as the second argument because `Contract.Map` is intented for this use only. If you don't use an in-site dictionary, rule [MCA1020: Missing Dictionary Entry](MCA1020.md) cannot apply.

## Sample code

```cs
private enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

private static void Foo()
{
    System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int> Table = new()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
    };

    return Contract.Map(c, Table); // MCA1021: Only use Contract.Map with in-site dictionary.
}
```

Compliant code:

```cs
private enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

private static void Foo()
{
    int Bar = Contract.Map(Color.Red, new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int>()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
    });
}
```
