# MCA1019: Verified property is missing suffix

If a property has any of the contract attributes (`Access`, `Require` or `Ensure`) then it should end with the `Verified` suffix (or the suffix defined in the project settings).

## Sample code

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")] // MCA1019: Verified property is missing suffix.
private static void Foo
{
    get { return 0; }
}
```

Conformant code:

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")]
private static void FooVerified
{
    get { return 0; }
}
```
