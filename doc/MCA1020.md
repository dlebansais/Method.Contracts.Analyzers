# MCA1020: Missing Dictionary Entry

This rule detects at compile-time if a call to `Contract.Map()` will likely fail. It does so by comparing the number of enum values with the number of entries in the dictionary. If they are different, either one of these will occur at run-time:
+ Building the dictionary with throw an exception indicating a duplicate key, or
+ The call will fail because the enum contains more values than the dictionary contains entries.

## Sample code

```cs
private enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
    White, // This key is not in the dictionary.
}

private static void Foo()
{
    int Bar = Contract.Map(Color.Red, new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int>()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
    }); // MCA1020: The Dictionary is missing an entry.
}
```

Compliant code:

```cs
private enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
    White,
}

private static void Foo()
{
    int Bar = Contract.Map(Color.Red, new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<Color, int>()
    {
        { Color.Red,   0xFF0000 },
        { Color.Green, 0x00FF00 },
        { Color.Blue,  0x0000FF },
        { Color.White, 0xFFFFFF }, // Missing entry added.
    });
}
```
