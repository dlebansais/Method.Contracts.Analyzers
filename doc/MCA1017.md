# MCA1017: Verified property must be private

If a property has any of the contract attributes (`Access`, `Require` or `Ensure`) then it should be private.

## Sample code

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")] // MCA1017: Verified property must be private.
protected static int FooVerified
{
    get { return 0; }
}
```
